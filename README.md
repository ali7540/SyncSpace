# 🚀 SyncSpace — Real-Time Collaborative Workspace

**SyncSpace** is a next-generation digital workspace that empowers teams to collaborate seamlessly in real time — like **Notion meets Figma**. It enables users to write, edit, and brainstorm together on shared documents, notes, or whiteboards with **instant synchronization** and **version control**.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Teams often struggle with collaboration when ideas, notes, and project updates are scattered across multiple tools. Traditional platforms fail to provide **smooth, real-time editing** or **multi-user collaboration**.

**SyncSpace** solves this problem by offering a **shared digital workspace** where teams can:

* Write and edit together in real time
* See changes instantly across all devices
* Track and restore past document versions

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**Flow:**

```
Frontend → Backend (API + WebSocket) → Database
```

### **Frontend**

* **Next.js** – Dynamic routing & server-rendered UI
* **TailwindCSS** – Clean and responsive styling
* **Socket.io-client** – Real-time communication

### **Backend**

* **Node.js + Express.js** – RESTful APIs
* **Socket.io** – Real-time collaboration & user presence handling

### **Database**

* **PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)** – Structured and relational data storage

### **Authentication**

* **JWT-based Auth** – Role-based access: `Owner`, `Editor`, `Viewer`

### **Hosting**

* **Frontend (Vercel)** → https://sync-space-virid.vercel.app/
